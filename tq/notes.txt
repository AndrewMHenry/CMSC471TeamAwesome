Current Bugs
============================

Need to optimize the case where asking questions will 
have a result that returns no movies. 
  - Try to avoid this case as much as possible.
Optimize the case where the movies all have the same identical features.

TO DO:
Implement a way to add weight to a movie
If the game could not figure out the movie:
  then at end of game ask user to enter name of the movie.
  then record that name to a log file and give it a weight(0 or 1)
  you can increment a movie weight each time users choose it as
  their favorite movies
